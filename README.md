# iMPS

Personal code for finite MPS/MPO simulations, including DMRG, TDVP, etc..

## TODO

1. Reinitialize the tensor scheme, which can simplize the functions.
2. Change the Env calculation methods, which can heavily save the time
3. Change the initialization of MPS, add 2-site update/integration correspondly.
